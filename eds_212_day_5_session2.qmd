## Some logical operators

-   == (does this match? )

-   != (do these NOT match)

-   \>, \<,\<=,\>=

-   &, \| (\| for OR)

```{r}
#DOES 4 MATCH 5
4 == 5

4 == 4
#DOES 4 NOT MATCH 5?

4 != 5

4 > 5

4<5

4<=5

4>=5

# Does 4 the number match "4"?

4 == "4"

cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat == dog

# Is dog > cat, OR is cat less than 20
# Only one of these has to be true for it to be TRUE

dog>cat | cat<20

#Is DOG LESS THEN CAT AND CAT = 10
(dog < cat) & (cat == 10)

# All must be true for it to return as TRUE
(dog < cat) & (cat>2) & (4>= dog)
```

```{r}

ggplot(data = mtcars,aes( x = wt, y =mpg)) + geom_point(color = "red",aes(size = mpg)) + labs(x = "Car Weight(1000 pounds", y = "Gas mileage (mpg)", title = "Car weight efficiency relationship")
